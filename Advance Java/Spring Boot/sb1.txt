==================================
In spring framework a programmer is responsible for following things.

> Adding the depencies or jar files

> Performing the configurations (applicationContext.xml)

> Managing the physical servers like Tomcat and etc.

> Arranging the physical database like Oracle,MySQL and etc.

Spring Boot
============
It is an open source java based application framework developed by Pivotal Team.

It provides RAD (Rapid Application Development) features to spring based applications.

It is a production ready grade spring applications with minimum configurations.

In short , spring boot is a combination of 

	Spring Framework  + Embedded database + Embedded server

Spring boot does not support xml configuration instead we will use annotations.


Advantages of Spring Boot
==========================
It is used to create standalone application which can be started 
by using java -jar. 

It provide production ready grade features like metrix, healthcheck, externalized configurations and etc.

It provides optionate starters to simplify the Maven configurations.

It does not support xml configurations.

It test the web application by using HTTP servers like Tomcat, Jetty or Undertow.

It provides CLI tool for testing and developing spring boot applications.

 2) Using STS or IntelliJ IDE.


Q)Explain @SpringBootApplication Annotation?

 This annotation is a combination of three annotations.

   1) @EnableAutoConfiguration : 
	It enables Spring Bootâ€™s auto-configuration mechanism.

   2) @ComponentScan : 
	It scans on the package where the application is located.

   3) @Configuration : 
	It allows us to register extra beans in the context.




Spring Initializr
=================
It is a web based tool which is used to generate spring boot project structure.

ex:
	https://start.spring.io/


Steps to develop first spring boot application 
---------------------------------------------

step1:
-------
	Goto spring initializr
	ex:
		https://start.spring.io/

step2:
-----
	Create a spring boot project i.e FirstSB.
	
	ex:
	project      : Maven 
	Language     : Java
	Dependencies : (don't add)
        Spring Boot  : 3.1.1
     
 	Project Metadata
        Group	    :	com.ihub.www
	Artifact    :	SBApp1
	Name        :	SBApp1
	Description : 	Demostration on Spring Boot
	Package name:   com.ihub.www
        packaging   :   jar 
        Java        :   8   
	--->  click on Generate button. 

step3:
-----
	Download and Install STS IDE.

	STS is a eclipse Based Environment.

	ex:
		https://spring.io/tools		

step4:
-----
	Launch STS IDE by choosing workspace location.

step5:
------
	Extract "SBApp1.zip" file in any loctation.

step6:
------
	Open "SBApp1" project in STS IDE.
	ex:
		File --> Open project from file system --> click to directory button.
		--> select FirstSB folder --> Finish.

step7:
-----
	Add custom message in SApp1Application.java file.
	
step8:
-----
	Run the spring boot appilication.
	ex:
	right click to the project --> run as --> spring boot application.
