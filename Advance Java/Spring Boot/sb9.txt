step1:
---------
	create a spring starter project.
	starters: spring web
		  spring security.

step2:
----------
	create a Controller to accept the request.
	
HomeController.java
--------------------------
package com.ge.www.controller;

import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class HomeController {

	@GetMapping("/msg")
	public String msg()
	{
		return "Welcome to Spring Security";
	}
}

step3:
--------
	Configure server port number in application.properties file.
application.yml
-----------------------------
server:
  port: 9191


step4:
----------
	Run the application as spring boot application.

step6:
----------
	Test the application by using below url.
	ex:
	http://localhost:9191/msg

Note:
--------
	When we hit the request ,we will get login page.
	Default username is "user" and password we can copy from STS console.

step7:
--------
	To change the default user and password we can use below properties in 
	application.properties file.

application.yml
-----------------------------
server:
  port: 9191

spring
  security:
    user:
      name=raja
      password=rani

step8:
----------	
	Relaunch the spring boot application.

step9:
----------
	Test the application by using below url.
	ex:
	http://localhost:9191/msg



How can we convert spring project to jar file
=============================================
step1:

	Make sure spring boot project is ready.

step2:
-----
	Create a jar file for spring boot project.
	ex:
		right click to project --> run as --> Maven build -->
