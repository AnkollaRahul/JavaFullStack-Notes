Servlets
=========

Web application
================
A web application is a collection of web resource programs having the capability to generate web pages.

We have two types of web pages.

1)static web page / passive web page 
------------------------------------
If a content not change for a web page is called static web page.
ex:
	facebook login page 
	home page 
	contactus page
	services page 
	and etc

2)Dynamic web page / active web page 
-----------------------------------
If a content change for a web page is called dynamic web page.
ex:
	live cricket score page
	stock market share value page 
	gmail inbox page
	and etc 

We have two types of web resource programs.

1)Static web resource program 
-----------------------------
It is used to generate static web pages.
ex:
	html program
	css program
	bootstrap program
	reactjs program
	angularjs program
	and etc.

2)Dynamic web resource program
-------------------------------
It is used to generate dynamic web pages.
ex:
	servlet program
	jsp program 
	and etc.

Based onthe position and execution these web resource programs are dividedi into two types.

1)Client side web resource program
-----------------------------
A web resource program which executes at client side(browser window) is called client side web resource program.

All static web resource programs are called client side web resource program.


2)Server side web resource program
----------------------------------
A web resource program which executes at server side is called server side web resource program.

All dynamic web resource programs are called server side web resource program.

Web application and web resource program execution 
===================================================
Diagram: servlet1.1

Java application will execute manually.

Web application and web resource program will execute at the time when they have requested.So there is no way to execute them manually.

With respect to the diagram:

1) Enduser will give the request to web resource program.

2) Web server will trap that request and passes that request to appropriate 
   web resource program.

3) Web resource program will execute the logic to process the request.

4) Web resource program will communicate with database software if neccessary.

5) Web resource program sends the output to web server.

6) Web server will give output to browser window as dynamic response. 

Note:
----
The process of keeping the web application in a server is called deployment and reverse is called undeployment.

Web Server 
============
A web server is a piece of software which is used to automate whole process of web application and web resource program execution.
ex:
	Tomcat , Resin and etc.

Responsibilities of web server
--------------------------------
> It takes continues request from client.

> It passes the request to appropriate web resource program.

> It provides environment to deploy and undeploy the web applications.

> It will add middleware services only to deployed web applications.

> It provides environment to execute client side web resource programs at 
  browser window.

> It is used to automate whole process of web application and web resource 
  program executions.

> Web server will send the output to browser window as dynamic web page.

Web container
=============
It is a software application or a program which is use manage whole life cycle of web resource program from birth to death.

Servlet container manage whole life cycle of servlet program.

JSP container manage whole life cycle of jsp program.

some part of industry consider servlet container and jsp container are web containers.

Every server is designed to support servlet container and jsp container so we don't need to arrange them seperately.

Tomcat 
=======
version		: 7.x 

Creator		: James Duncan Davidson

Vendor		: Apache software foundation 

Port No		: 8080 

website		: www.apache.org

servlet container : Catalina 

Jsp container   : Jasper

Tomcat install will ask following things.

1) Http Connector Port No 

2) Adminstrator username and password

3) JRE location (parallel to JDK)

4) Tomcat Installation location 

Tomcat is a not a container.It is a server containing servlet container and jsp container.

Before 6.x version tomcat is known as web server.From 6.x version onwards tomcat is also known as application server.

Installation of tomcat server
------------------------------
Right click to tomcat software --> yes ---> Next --> I Agree --> select Full -->
---> Next ---> 

Http connector port : 2525

adminstrative username : admin
	      password : admin   

--> next --> Next --> Install. 


Keeping Tomcat server from automatic mode to manual mode
========================================================
services (view local services) --> select Apache Tomcat --> click to stop link -->
double click to Apache tomcat --> startup type: manual -->Apply -->ok.
