To use any JDBC driver we need to register with DriverManager service.

Every JDBC application contains one built-in service called DriverManager service.


Class.forName()
================
It always recommanded to use Class.forName() method to register JDBC driver with DriverManager service.

It is used to load the driver class but it won't create an object.

ex:
	Class.forName("driver-class-name");

Connection object
==================
A Connection is an interface which is present in java.sql package.

It is an object of underlying supplied java class which implements java.sql.Connection interface.

If we want to interact with database we need to establish the connection with database software.

Once the work with database is completed, we need to close the Connection object.

ex:
	Connection con;


DriverManager.getConnection()
=============================
A DriverManager is a class which is present in java.sql package.

A getConnection() static method is used to interact with database software and returns JDBC Connection object representing connectivity between java application and database software.

ex:
	Connection con=DriverManager.getConnection("driver-url",username,pwd);


Statement object
=================
A Statement is an interface which is present in java.sql package.

It acts like a vehicle between java application and database software.

It is used to sends and executes SQL query in database software.

We can create Statement object as follow.

ex:
	Statement st=con.createStatement();

ResultSet object
=================
A ResultSet is an interface which is present in java.sql package.

Every ResultSet contains two positions.

1) BFR (Before First Record/Row)

2) ALR (After Last Record/Row)

Bydefault record pointer points to BFR position.

Every record ResultSet having 1 as base index and every record ResultSet having 1 as column index.

rs.next()
=========
It will move record pointer to next position from current position.

If next position is a record then it will return true.

If next position is ALR then it will return false.

To read the values from record ResultSet we need to use getXxx() method with index number or column name.

Here getXxx() method means getInt(),getFloat(),getDouble() and etc.

student table
=============
drop table student;

create table student(sno number(3),sname varchar2(10),sadd varchar2(12));

insert into student values(101,'raja','hyd');
insert into student values(102,'ravi','delhi');
insert into student values(103,'ramana','vizag');

commit;

select * from student;


Q)Difference between Oracle and MongoDB?

Oracle 					MongoDB
-------					--------
It is a RDBMS database.			MongoDB is a document base database. 

table					Collection

row					document 

column					field

Types of Queries in JDBC
============================
According JDBC point of view we have two types of queries.

1)Select Query 

2)Non-Select Query 

1)Select Query 
--------------
A select query will give bunch of records from database.
ex:
	select * from student;

A JDBC Statement object gave executeQuery() method to execute select query.
ex:
	ResultSet rs=st.executeQuery("select * from student");


2)Non-Select Query
-----------------
A non-select query will return numeric value represent number of records effected in a database table.
ex:
	delete from student;

A JDBC Statement object gave executeUpdate() method to execute non-select query.
ex:
	int result=st.executeQuery("delete from student");
