JDBC
=====
As if know it is known as trademark.

But earlier it is called as Java Database Connectivity.

RAM is a temperory storage device or medium.

During the program execution our data will store in RAM.

Once the program execution is completed we will loss the data.

To overcome this limitation we are making our application writing the data into file or database software.

Files and Database softwares act like a permanent storage device or medium.

Persistence 
===========
The process of storing and managing the data for a long period of time is called persistence.


Important Terminologies
=======================

1) Persistence Store
-------------------
It is a place where we can store and manage the data for a long period of time.
ex:
	Database software's 
	Files  
 
2) Persistence Data 
-------------------
Data of a persistence store is called persistence data.
ex:
	tables / collections 
	records 
	

3) Persistence operation 
-------------------------
Insert,update,delete,create and etc are called persistence operation.
In the realtime this operation is also known as CURD operation, CRUD operation, SCUD operation.
ex:
	C - create		S - select   
	U - update 		C - create 
	R - read 		U - update 
	D - delete 		D - delete 

4) Persistence logic 
--------------------
A logic which is capable to perform persistence operations is called persistence logic.
ex:
	JDBC code 
	Hibernate code 
	IOStream 
	

5) Persistence technology 
-------------------------
A technology which is used to develop persistence logic is called persistence technology.
ex:
	JDBC
	Hibernate 
	JPA 
	and etc.

Q)What is JDBC?

JDBC is a persistence technology which is used to develop persistence logic having the capability to perform persistence operations on persistence data of a persistence store.

Note:
-----
				JDBC Code 
	JavaApp	-------------------------------------- DB S/W's


				IOStream 
	JavaApp -------------------------------------- Files 	
		      Serialization/Deserialization 



Serialization
==============
The process of storing object data into a file is called serialization.

In serialization, object will not store in a file instead object data will store in a file.

Diagram: jdbc1.1

In general, Serialization means converting object state to file state.

Deserialization 
===============
The process of taking the data from a file and represent an object is called deserialization.

Diagram: jdbc1.2

Limitations with Files as persistence store 
===========================================
> It will store limited amount of data.

> There is no security.

> Fetching the data with multiple conditions is not possible.

> It does not show an application with relationship.

> It does not allow us to apply constraints (primary key,unique key,not null).

> Updation and Deletion of data can't be done directly.

> Merging and comparision of data can't be done easily.


Advantages of Database software as persistence store 
=====================================================
> We can store unlimited amount of data.

> There is a security.

> It supports common query language.

> Fetching the data with multiple conditions is possible.

> It shows an application with relationships.

> It allows us to apply constraints.

> Deletion and Updation of data can be done directly.

> Merging and comparision of data can be done easily.

Every JDBC application is a two-tier application where java with JDBC code acts like a frontend/tier1/layer1 and database software acts like a backend/tier2/layer2.

Enduser is a non-technical person.He can't prepare and execute SQL query in datatabase software.So he depends upon frontend developers having the capability to do that work for him.

JDBC Driver
===========
It acts like a bridge between java application and database software.

It is used to convert Java calls to database calls and vice versa.

Here calls means instructions.

Diagram: jdbc1.4
 

ODBC Driver
===========
VBScript, Perl, D2k and etc uses ODBC driver to interact with database software.

Diagram: jdbc1.5

ODBC driver is developed by using c language by taking the support of pointers.But Java does not support pointers.To overcome this limitation Sun Micro System introduced JDBC driver exclusively.

We will get JDBC softwares from three parties.

1) Sun Micro System (creator of JDBC driver)

2) Database vendor 

3) Third party vendor 


We will get ODBC softwares from three parties.

1) Xopen company (creator of ODBC driver)

2) Database vendor 

3) Third party vendor 



Q)What is JDBC?

It is a open technology given by Sun Micro System having set of rules and guidelines to develop JDBC drivers for multiple database softwares.
