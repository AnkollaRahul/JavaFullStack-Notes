select command
==============
It is used to select the records from database table.

syntax:
	select * from <table_name>;

	Here '*' means all rows and columns.

ex:
	
	select * from emp;
	select * from dept;
	select * from student;

Projection:
-----------
Selecting specific columns from the database table is called projection.
ex:
	select sno,sname,sadd from student;
	
	select sno,sname from student;
	
	select sno from student;

In select command we can perform arithmetic operations also.
ex:
	select sno+100 from student;
	select sno-100 from student;
	select sno*10 from student;	

Column alias
------------
A userdefined heading given to a column is called column alias.

Column alias can be applied to any column.

Column alias are temperory , once the query is executed we will loss the column alias.

	select sno as roll_no ,sname as Name,sadd as City from student;

Logical Operators 
================
Logical operators are used to declare multiple conditions in where clause.

We have three logical operators.

1) AND 

2) OR 

3) NOT 

1) AND 
------
It will return the records if all the conditions are true.

In AND operator all conditions must be from same row.

ex:
---
	select * from emp where ename='Alan' AND esal=9000;	

	select * from emp where ename='Alan' AND esal=19000; // no rows selected 

2) OR 
------
It will return the records if any condition is true.

In OR operator conditions can be from any row.

ex:
	select * from emp where ename='Alan' OR esal=9000;

	select * from emp where ename='Alan' OR esal=19000;	

	select * from emp where ename='Alan' OR esal=79000;	

3) NOT 
------
It will return all the records except the condition.

A '<>' symbol denoted as NOT operator.

ex:
	select * from student where NOT sno=101;
	select * from student where  sno<>101;
	
	select * from student where NOT sname='raja';
	select * from student where sname<>'raja';
