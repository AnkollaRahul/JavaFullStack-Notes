Types of data
=============
We have two types of data.

1) Unstructured Data
--------------------
Data which is not in readable format is called unstructured data.

In general, meaning less data is called unstructured data.

ex:
	302	Lakemba		SYD	NSW	AUS	 

2) Structured Data 
-------------------
Data which is in readable format is called structured data.

In general, meaning full data is called structured data.

ex:
	unit    locality        city    state   country
        ----    --------        ----    -----   -------
	302	Lakemba		SYD	NSW	AUS



Oracle
=======
Oracle is one of the database which is used to store structured data.

Oracle is a product of Oracle Corporation.

Oracle is a case insensitive language.

Oracle is classified into two types.

				Oracle 
				|
	-------------------------------------------------
	|						|				
	SQL						PL/SQL
(Structured Query Language)			(Procedural/Structured Query Language)
     Develop by IBM					Develop by Oracle Corporation

Client-Server Architecture 
==========================
In this architecture we will see how our data will store from frontend to backend.

Diagram: oracle1.1

FrontEnd
---------
The one which is visible to the enduser to perform some operations is called frontend.
ex:
	Java, .net, Python, Ruby, Perl and etc.

Communication Channel
---------------------
It acts like a bridge between frontend and backend.
ex:
	JDBC - Java Database Connectivity 
	ODBC - Open Database Connectivity
	PDBC - Python Database Connectivity 
	and etc

BackEnd
--------
The one which is not visible to the enduser but it performs operations based on the instructions given by frontend is called backend.
ex:
	Oracle, MySQL, SQL Server, MongoDB, NoSQL, TeraData, DB2, Sybase and etc.


Management System
==================
Management system is a software which is used to manage the database.

Management system will perform following activities very easily.

1) Inserting new data 

2) Modifying existing data 

3) Deleting unnecessary data 

4) Selecting required data

DBMS
====
A database along with software which is used to manage the database is called database management system.


RDBMS
=====
Any database which is developed based on relational theories which is used to manage the database is called relational database management system.
ex:
	Oracle, MySQL, SQL Server, PostgreSQL and etc.

SQL
====
SQL stands for Structured Query Language which is pronounce as SEQUEL.

This language is used to communicate with oracle database.

It is a command based language.

It is a case insensitive language.

Every command must starts with verb.
ex:
	select, update, delete, drop and etc.

Every command must ends with semicolon.

It is developed by Mr.Codd in 1972 (By IBM).

Sub-Languages of SQL
====================
We have five sub-language of SQL.

1) DDL (Data Definition Language)

2) DML (Data Manipulation Language)

3) DRL/DQL (Data Retrieve/Query Language) 

4) TCL 	(Transaction Control Language)

5) DCL  (Data Control Language)

1) DDL (Data Definition Language)
----------------------------------
This language is used to maintain the objects in database.

It is a collection of five commands.
ex:
	create,alter,drop,truncate and rename.

2) DML (Data Manipulation Language)
-----------------------------------
This language is used to manipulate the data present in database.

It is a collection of four commands.

ex:
	insert,update,delete and merge.
	
3) DRL/DQL (Data Retrieve/Query Language) 
--------------------------------
This language is used to retrieve the data from database.

It is a collection of one command.
ex:
	select 

4) TCL 	(Transaction Control Language)
-------------------------------------
This language is used to maintain the transaction of database.

It is a collection of three commands.
ex:
	commit,rollback and savepoint.

5) DCL  (Data Control Language)
-------------------------------
This language is used to control the access of data to the user.

It is a collection of two commands.

ex:
	grant and revoke.


Table
======
Table is an object which is used to represent the data.

Table is a collection of rows and columns.

Oracle is a case insensitive but data present in a table is a case sensitive.

ex:
	
	SNO	|	SNAME	|	SADD
	-------------------------------------	
	101	|	raja	|	hyd
	-------------------------------------
	102	|	ravi	|	delhi
	-------------------------------------
	103	|	ramana	|	vizag
	-------------------------------------
			
	Here we have 3 rows and 3 columns.

Establish the Connection with Database
=======================================
To perform any operation on database we need to need to connect with database.

Once the work with database is completed then we need to disconnect with database.

There are following ways to connect and disconnect the database.

1) 
SQL > connect 
	username: system 
	password: admin 
SQL > disconnect


2) 
SQL > conn
	username: system 
	password: admin 
SQL > disc

3)
SQL > conn system/admin
SQL > disc 


create command
===============
It is used to create a table(object) in a database.

syntax:
	create table <table_name>(col1 datatype(size),col2 datatype(size),....,
					colN datatype(size));

ex:
	create table student(sno number(3),sname varchar2(10),sadd varchar2(12));

	create table dept(deptno number(3),dname varchar2(10),dloc varchar2(12));
	
	create table emp(eid number(3),ename varchar2(10), esal number(10,2),
				deptno number(3),job varchar2(10), comm number(6));


Describe command
===============
It is used to describe the structure of the table.

syntax:
	desc  <table_name>;
ex:
	desc student;
	desc dept;
	desc emp;


insert command
===============
It is used to insert the data in a database table.

syntax:
------
	insert into <table_name> values(val1,val2,..,valN);

ex:
	insert into student values(101,'raja','hyd');

	insert into student values('raja',102,'delhi'); // invalid 

	insert into student values(102,'ravi'); //invalid 

	A null is a keyword which represent undefined or unavailable.
	
	insert into student values(102,'ravi',null); 

Approach2
-------
	insert into student(sno,sname,sadd) values(103,'ramana','vizag'); 

	insert into student(sno,sname) values(105,'rakesh'); 

Approach3
---------
	Using '&' symbol we can read dynamic inputs.
	ex:
		insert into student values(&sno,'&sname','&sadd');

commit command
=============
It is used to make the changes permanent to database.

syntax:
	commit;
