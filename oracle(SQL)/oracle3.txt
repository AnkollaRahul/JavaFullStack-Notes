Between operator
================
Between operator will return the records those who are in the range of values.

Between operator will take the support of AND operator.

In Between operator first we need to declare lower limit then higher limit.

ex:
	select * from emp where eid between 201 AND 206;

	select * from emp where eid between 206 AND 201; // no rows selected

	select * from emp where esal between 15000 AND 30000;

	select eid,ename,esal from emp where deptno between 10 AND 30;


IN operator
===========
IN operator is a replacement of OR operator.

It will return the values those who are matching in the list of values.

ex:
	select * from emp where eid IN(201,202,203);

	select * from emp where deptno IN(10,20,30);

	select * from emp where ename IN ('Alan','Jose','Nelson');


Pattern Matching operators
===========================
Pattern matching operators are used to select the letters from database table.

Pattern matching operators will take the support of like keyword.

We have two types of pattern matching operators.

1) Percentage(%) 

2) Underscore(_) 

1) Percentage(%) 
----------------
Q)Write a query to display employee information whose employee name starts with 'A' letter?

	select * from emp where ename like 'A%';



Q)Write a query to display employee information whose employee name ends with 'n' letter?

	select * from emp where ename like '%n';


Q)Write a query to display employee information whose employee name having 'l' as middle letter?

	select * from emp where ename like '%l%';

2) Underscore(_) 
-----------------

Q) Write a query to display employee information whose employee name having 
   second letter as 'l' letter?

	select * from emp where ename like '_l%';


Q)Write a query to display employee information whose employee name having 
  second last letter as 'd'?

	select * from emp where ename like '%d_';


Q)Write a query to display employee information whose employee name having 
third letter as 'a'?

	select * from emp where ename like '__a%';


Duplicate table or Copy of a table
==================================
Creating a duplicate table or copy of a table is a save side for the programmer because if something goes wrong we can recover that situation using duplicate table or copy of a table.

Using create and select command we can create duplicate table.

ex:
---
	create table stud as select * from student;

	create table employee as select * from emp;

	create table employee as select eid,ename,esal from emp;

	create table employee as select * from emp where deptno=10;

	create table employee as select * from emp where deptno<>10;

	create table employee as select * from emp eid IN(201,202,203);

	create table employee as select * from emp esal between 15000 AND 30000;

	create table employee as select * from emp name like 'A%';

cl scr
=======
It is used to clear the output screen of SQL command prompt.

syntax:
	cl scr

DDL commands
============
create - (tables)
alter  - (columns)
drop   - (tables)
truncate - (rows/records)
rename - (tables)

alter command
=============
Using alter command we can perform following activities very easily.

i) Adding the new columns

ii) Modifying the exiting columns 

iii) Renaming the columns

iv) Droping the columns

i) Adding the new columns
--------------------------
Using alter command we can add new columns to a existing table.

syntax:
-----
	alter table <table_name> ADD (col datatype(size));

ex:
	alter table student ADD (state varchar2(10));
	alter table student ADD (pincode number(8));
	alter table student ADD (state varchar2(10), pincode number(8));

	update student set state='Telangana' where sno=101;

ii) Modifying the exiting columns 
------------------------------
Using alter command we can modify the existing columns.

We can change size of a column only when existing values are fit into new size.

ex:
	desc  student;

	alter table student MODIFY (state varchar2(12));
	
	desc student;

We can change the datatype of a column only if that column is empty.

ex:
---
	desc student;

	alter table student MODIFY (pincode varchar2(8));

	desc student;

iii) Renaming a columns 
------------------------
Using alter command we can rename a column name.

syntax:
	alter table <table_name> RENAME column <old_name> to <new_name>

ex:
	alter table student RENAME  column  pincode to country;

	alter table student RENAME  column  sadd to city;

	alter table emp RENAME  column  esal to dailywages;

	alter table emp RENAME  column  job to designation;


iv)dropping the columns
------------------------
Using alter command we can drop the columns.

syntax:
	alter table <table_name> DROP (col1,col2,..,colN);
ex:
	alter table student DROP (state,country);

drop  command
=============
It is used to drop the tables from database.

syntax:
	drop table <table_name>;
ex:
	drop table student;
	drop table emp;
	drop table dept;

truncate command
==================
A trunate command is used to delete the records permanently from database table.

syntax:
	truncate table <table_name>;
ex:
	truncate table emp;
	truncate table student;
	truncate table dept;

Q) What is the difference between delete and truncate command?

delete					truncate 
----------				----------
It will delete the records temperory.	It will delete the records permanently.

We can rollback the data.		We can't rollback the data.

Where clause can be used.		Where clause can't be used.

It is a DML command.			It is a DDL command.


rename command
==============
It is used to rename the table name.

syntax:
	rename  <old_name> to <new_name>;

ex:
	rename emp to employee;

	rename student to students;
	
	rename dept to department; 


Functions
==========
Functions are used to manipulate the data items and give the result.

We have two types of functions.

1) Group Functions / Multiple Rows Functions 

2) Scalar Functions / Single Rows Functions 

1) Group Functions
-------------------
Group functions are applicable for multiple rows.

We have following list of group functions.

ex:
	sum(), avg(), max(), min(), count(*) and count(express). 


Q) Write a query to display sum of salary of each employee?

	select sum(esal) from emp;

Q) Write a query to display average salary of each employee?

	select avg(esal) from emp;	

Q) Write a query to display highest salary from employee table?

	select max(esal) from emp;

Q) Write a query to display least/lowest salary from employee table?

	select min(esal) from emp;


Q)What is the difference between count(*) and count(exp)? 

count(*)
--------
	It will return number of records present in database table.

	It will include null records.
 
	ex:
		select count(*) from emp;

count(exp)
---------
	It will return number of values present in a column.

	It will not include null values.
	
	ex:
		select count(eid) from emp;
	
		select count(comm) from emp;

Userlist table
===============
drop table userlist;

create table userlist(uname varchar2(10),pwd varchar2(10));

insert into userlist values('raja','rani');

insert into userlist values('king','kingdom');

commit;

Q) Write a query to check username and password is valid or not?

	select count(*) from userlist where uname='raja' AND pwd='rani'; // 1 

	select count(*) from userlist where uname='raja' AND pwd='rani2'; // 0
