TCL commands
=============
1) commit
2) rollback
3) savepoint 

1) commit
-----------
It is used to make the changes permanent to database.

ex:
	drop table student;

	create table student(sno number(3),sname varchar2(10),sadd varchar2(12));

	insert into student values(101,'raja','hyd');
	
	insert into student values(102,'ravi','delhi');

	commit;
	
2) rollback
-----------
It is used to undo the changes which are not permanent.

syntax:
	rollback;

ex:
	drop table student;

	create table student(sno number(3),sname varchar2(10),sadd varchar2(12));

	insert into student values(101,'raja','hyd');
	
	insert into student values(102,'ravi','delhi');

	commit;

	insert into student values(103,'ramana','vizag');
	
	insert into student values(104,'ramulu','pune');

	select * from student; //4 records 

	rollback;

	select * from student; //2 records 
	
3) savepoint
--------------
It is used to make logical transaction in a database table.

Instead of complete rollback we can rollback upto savepoint.

syntax:
		savepoint <save_point_name>;

ex:
	drop table student;

	create table student(sno number(3),sname varchar2(10),sadd varchar2(12));

	insert into student values(101,'raja','hyd');
	
	insert into student values(102,'ravi','delhi');

	savepoint sp1;

	insert into student values(103,'ramana','vizag');
	
	insert into student values(104,'ramulu','pune');

	savepoint sp2;

	insert into student values(105,'Jack','USA');
	
	insert into student values(106,'James','UK');

	select * from student; // 6 records 
		
	rollback to sp2;

	select * from student; // 4 records 

	rollback to sp1;

	select * from student; // 2 records 

DCL commands
============
1) grant 
2) revoke 

Schema:
-------
	Schema is a memory location which is used to run SQL commands.

Privileges:
----------
	Permissions given to a user is called privileges.

	In general, rights given to a user is called privileges. 

	We have two types of privileges.

	1) System privilege : Permissions given by DBA to user.

	2) Object privilege : Permissions given by one user to another user.
	

1) grant 
--------
It is used to grant the permissions to the user.

syntax:
	grant <resource1>,<resource2> to <user_name>;

2) revoke
----------
It is used to revoke the permissions from the user.

syntax:
	revoke <resource1>,<resource2> from <user_name>;


DBA> create user aravind identified by aravind;
DBA> create user manasa identified by manasa;


Aravind> conn aravind/aravind      --logon denied

Manasa> conn manasa/manasa	   --logon denied


DBA> grant connect,resource to aravind,manasa;	

Aravind> conn aravind/aravind      

Manasa> conn manasa/manasa


Aravind>
create table employee(eid number(3),ename varchar2(10),esal number(10));
insert into employee values(201,'Alan',10000);
insert into employee values(202,'Jose',20000);
insert into employee values(203,'Mark',30000);
commit;
select * from employee;

Manasa>  select * from employee; //table or view does not exist

Aravind> grant select on employee to manasa;

Manasa> select * from aravind.employee;

Manasa> delete from aravind.employee;   --insufficient privileges

Aravind> grant delete,update on employee to manasa;

Manasa> delete from aravind.employee;   
Manasa> commit;

Aravind> select * from employee; // no rows selected

Aravind> revoke select,update,delete on employee from manasa;

Manasa> disc 
Aravind> disc 

DBA> revoke connect,resource from aravind,manasa;


Pseudo Columns
==============
A pseudo column means a column which is not real.

We have two pseudo columns.

1) ROWNUM 

2) ROWID 

1) ROWNUM 
---------
ROWNUM values always starts with 1 and increment by 1.

ROWNUM values are temperory.Once the query is executed we will loss the rownum values.

ex:
	select eid,ename,esal from emp;
	select rownum,eid,ename,esal from emp;
	select rownum,sno,sname,sadd from student;

2) ROWID
--------
ROWID is a memory address where our records will store in a database table.

ROWID is permanent.

ex:
	select rowid,eid,ename,esal from emp;
	select rowid,rownum,eid,ename,esal from emp;
	

Interview Queries
----------------
Q) Write a query to see the list of users present in database?

	select username from all_users;

Q) Write a query to drop the user?

	drop user aravind cascade;
	drop user manasa cascade;


Q) Write a query to display first three records from employee table?

	select * from emp where rownum<=3;


Q) Write a query to display exact fourth record from employee table?

	select * from emp where rownum<=4
	minus
	select * from emp where rownum<=3;


Synonyms
========
Alternate name given to a table is called synonym.

We can use synonym name instead of table name for all the commands.

Using synonym, length of the table will reduce.

syntax:
	create synonym <synonym_name> for <table_name>;
ex:
	create synonym sy1 for student;

	select * from sy1;
	
	delete from sy1;


Q) Write a query to the list of synonyms present in database?

	select synonym_name from user_synonyms;


Q) Write a query to drop the synonyms?
	
	drop synonym  sy1;
