Comments in java
=================
Comments are created for documentation purpose.

Comments are used to improve readability of our code.

It is highly recommanded to use comments in our regular programming.

Comments will not display in output because our compiler does not compile the comments.

In java we have two types of comments.

1)Single Line Comment
-------------------
	It is used to comment a single line.
	ex:
		// comment here 

2)Multiple Line Comment 
------------------------
	It is used to comment multiple lines.
	ex:
		/*
			-
			- comment here 
			-
		*/

ex:
----
//class declaration 
class  Test
{
	//main method	
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{

		//variable declaration 
		int i=10;	

		//output statement
		System.out.println(i);
	}
}
