History of Java
===============
In 1990, Sun Micro system took one project to develop a software called consumer electronic device which can be controlled by a remote like setup box.
That time project was called Stealth project and later is renamed to Green project.

James Gosling , Mike Sheridan, Patrick Naughton were there to develop this project and they met in a place called Aspan/Colarado to start the work with Graphic System.James Gosling decided to use C and C++ languages to develop this project.But the problem what they have faced is they are system dependent.Then James Gosling decided  why don't we create our own programming language which is system independent.

In 1991, they have developed on programming language called an OAK.OAK means strength, itself is a coffee seed name and it is a national tree for many contries like Germany , France , USA and etc. Later in 1995 they have renamed OAK to Java.Java is a island of an Indonasia where first coffee of seed was produced and during the development of project they were consuming lot of coffee's.Hence symbol of java is a cup of coffee with saucer.

Interview questions
====================

   It is platform independent

Q)What is the difference between JDK , JRE or JVM ?

JDK
=====
JDK stands for Java Development Kit.

It is a installable software which consist Java Runtime Environment (JRE),
Java Virtual Machine (JVM), Compiler (javac) , Interpreter (java), archiever (.jar) , document generator (javadoc) and other tools needed for java application development.

JRE
====
JRE stands for Java Runtime Environment.
It provides very good environment to run java applications only.

JVM
====
JVM stands for Java Virtual Machine.
It is used to execute our program line by line procedure.

Identifiers
===========
A name in java is called identifier.

It can be class name, variable name , method name or label name.

ex:
	class Test
	{
		public static void main(String[] args)
		{
			int i = 10;
	
			System.out.println(i);
		}	
	}

	Here Test,main,args and i are identifiers.

Rules to declare an identifiers
---------------------------------
Rule1:
------
	Identifier will accept following characters.
	ex:
		A-Z
		a-z
		0-9
		_
		$

Rule2:
------
	If we take other characters then we will get compile time error.
	ex:
		int  $=10; //valid 

		int  _abcd; //valid 

		int  #=20; //invalid 

Rule3:
-----
	Identifier must and should starts with alphabet,underscore or 
	dollar symbol but not with digits.
	ex:
		int  a1234; //valid 

		int  _1234; //valid 
		
		int  1abcd; //invalid 

Rule4:
-----
	Every identifier is a case sensitive.
	ex:
		int number;
		int NUMBER;
		int NumBer; 

Rule5:
------
	We can't take reserved words as an identifier name.
	ex:
		int  if;//invalid 
		int  else; //invalid 

Rule6:
-----
	There is no length limit for an identifier but it is not recommanded
	to take more then 15 characters.


Rule7:
-----
	We can take predefined classes and interfaces as an identifier name 
	but it is not good programming practice.
	ex:
		int  System=10;
		int  Runnable=20;
