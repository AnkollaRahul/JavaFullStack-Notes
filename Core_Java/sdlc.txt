SDLC
=====
SDLC stands for Software Development Life Cycle.

It is a process adopt by IT industry to develop accurate and quality of softwares.

There are six phases are there in SDLC.

1)Feasibility study

2)Analysis

3)Designing 

4)Coding 

5)Testing

6)Delivery and Maintainence


1)Feasibility study
-------------------
Feasibility study completed depends upon TELOS formulea.
ex:
	T - Technical Feasibility
	E - Ecnomical Feasibility
	L - Legal Feasibility
	O - Operational Feasibility
        S - Scheduled Feasibility 

All the above information they will keep in a document called BDD.

BDD stands for Business Designed Document. 


2)Analysis 
-------------
In this phase , system analyst or product owner will involved.

They will seperate system requirements and software requirements.

They will keep this information in a document called SRS.

SRS stands Software Requirement Specification.


3)Designing 
-----------
Designing can be performed in two ways.

i)High level designing
--------------------
	Manager is responsible to perform high level designing.

	In high level designing ,we will design main modules.

ii)Low level designing 
--------------------
	Team Lead/Project Lead is resposible to perform low level designing.

	In low level designing , we will design sub-module/child modules.

All this above information we will keep in a document called PDD/TDD.

Here PDD stands for Project Design Document.
Here TDD stands for Technical Design Document.

4)Coding
-----------
In coding phase, developers will involved.

Developers are responsible to generate the build(source code).

Once our build is ready then developer even responsible to perform white box testing.


5)Testing Phase 
-----------------
In this phase, testing team or QA team will involved.

The will test the code by using one software component called STLC.

STLC stands for Software Testing Life Cycle.

Testing Team or QA team is responsible to perform black box testing.


6)Delivery  & maintainence phase
---------------------------------
Before delivery we will perform UAT testing.

UAT stands for User Acceptance Testing.

UAT testing is classified into two types.

i)Alpha testing

ii)Beta testing 


Project
=========
Project is a collection of modules.
ex:
	customer module
	login module
	registration module
	payment module
	report generation module
	and etc.

Every project contains two domains.

1)Technical Domain 
---------------
	Using which technology we developed our project.
	ex:
		Java
	
2)Functional Domain 
-----------------
	It describes state of a project.
	ex:
		Healthcare domain 
		Insaurance domain 
		Banking domain 
		ERP domain 
		and etc.
